  <h1>Summary</h1>
    <p>
      Full stack Developer - I'll work with anything.
      Experience working in teams - it's where I do my best work. My emotional intelligence is high. I have experience leading teams and as a team member. I am comfortable in both roles. My systematic approach to problem solving has been directly transferable to my course work, breaking down large scale complext problems into managable tasks. My previous experience solving complex hydrogeological problems combined with my mentally flexibility, adaptability and agility makes me a unique candidate. This combination allows for different approach to solving complex technological problems. I am looking to bring value to a company that understands and demonstrates employee investment as a pillar of their success. The tech industry helps people - I want to help make people's lives better through the use of technology.
